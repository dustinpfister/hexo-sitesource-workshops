In [three.js](https://threejs.org/) there are some eight materials to choose from to help skin a mesh. There are also additional materials for rendering lines, points, shadows, and sprites. This post will serve as a general overview of materials in general in three.js.

## What to know

This is not my getting started post on three.js, if you are new to three.js you might choose to start there. This is an advanced post on three.js in which I assume you have basic knowledge of how to make a three.js project, and now only seek to have a deeper understanding of materials.

## Version number matters with three.js

Three.js is a project in which the version number matters a whole lot. Older posts on three.js often contain examples that will break on newer revisions and vise versa. In most of these posts I have been sticking to three.js 0.91.0 (r91)
