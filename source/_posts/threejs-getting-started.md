I have been wanting to write a series of posts in [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for a while now, and I do not care to put it off any longer. I have fiddled with three.js in the past, but never really got into it. I have enough experience with it to know that it helps making projects the involve 3d objects very easy, yet it is still something that takes a significant investment of time to get fairly solid with.

Also three.js is one of those javaScript projects that is just plain awesome. Working with solid geometric space is one of the main reasons why I got into programing in the first place, so of course I need to write about this one, how can I not? So this will be a getting started post, that will kick off at least around ten additional posts on this subject, and I can see it going beyond that easy.

## A word about three.js versions

Three.js is a project where the version number matters a lot, very significant changes are still being made all the time. In this demo I am using [version r91](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/r91/build).
