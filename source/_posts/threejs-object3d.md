The [Object3D](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/core/Object3D) base class in [three.js](https://threejs.org/) is one of the most important classes to be aware of when making some kind of project involving three.js. It is in use in many objects in three.js including things like cameras, lights, and the the Meshes that are placed in a Scene. This base class adds a whole bunch of common properties, and methods for any kind of object in the project. Once you know a thing or two about Object3D the same methods will work with any and all objects that inherent from Object3D, which is a lot.

## Basic example of Object3d

Typically I do not work with the class directly, I work with something that inherits properties and methods from Object3d. Still if for some reason I want to work with the class directly I can do so via the THREE.Object3d constructor.

```js
    // Object 3d position
    var obj3d = new THREE.Object3D();
 
    // {"x":0,"y":0,"z":0}
    console.log(JSON.stringify(obj3d.position));
 
    obj3d.position.set(3, 4, 5);
 
    // {"x":3,"y":4,"z":5}
    console.log(JSON.stringify(obj3d.position));
```

Here I made just a simple example where I am just playing with the position property, which is an instance of Vector3. This can be used to set the center point of the object in a Scene. In the case that the Object is a child of another object it would be the position relative to the parent Object.
