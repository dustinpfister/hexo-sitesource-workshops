The [Object3D](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/core/Object3D) base class in [three.js](https://threejs.org/) is one of the most important classes to be aware of when making some kind of project involving three.js. It is in use in many objects in three.js including things like cameras, lights, and the the Meshes that are placed in a Scene. This base class adds a whole bunch of common properties, and methods for any kind of object in the project. Once you know a thing or two about Object3D the same methods will work with any and all objects that inherent from Object3D, which is a lot.
