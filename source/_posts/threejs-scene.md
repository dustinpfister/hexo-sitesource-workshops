A [Scene](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/scenes/Scene) in [three.js](https://threejs.org/) is a constructor that can be used to create an instance of Scene that can be used to place everything that makes up an environment in a three.js project. It can contain cameras, lights, and of course objects composed of a geometry and material.

In this post I will be covering Scenes in a bit of detail as I continue to expand, and improve [my content on three.js](/categories/three-js/)

## What to know

This is an advanced post on [three.js](https://threejs.org/) that covers just one little constructor known as [THREE.Scene](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/scenes/Scene). If you are new to three.js you might want to start with my getting started post on three.js. If you are new to javaScript in general that is outside the scope of this whole collection of [posts on three.js](/categories/three-js/).
