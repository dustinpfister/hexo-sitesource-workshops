This month I have been working towards developing a solid understanding of the basics of [three.js](https://threejs.org/) as it is a great project that helps with everything, and anything 3d in a javaScript environment. As such it was only a matter of time until I would get around to working out a few quick demos about how to work with lines in three.js. Doing so is not that hard at all, and can quickly become very fun allowing me to draw in 3d. 

<!-- more -->

There is only so much to write about with the base Line constructor in three.js, so to help keep this post from being to thin I will also be writing about LineLoop, Line3, and the Materials that can be used with Lines. So this will be a getting started post on lines, but also get into a greater degree of depth about what there is to know to really get going with this.

## What you should know before hand

This is an advanced post on just one little aspect of three.js which is a javaScript project that allows for doing things involving solid geometry. It is not a getting started post on three.js, or any additional aspects of javaScript in general. I am also of course not going to get into every little detail about other relating subjects such as geometry, and physics.
