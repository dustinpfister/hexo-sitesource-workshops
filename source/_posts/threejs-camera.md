If you want to make a three.js project you are going to want to know a thing or two about how to go about working with cameras. In three.js there are a few cameras to work with, but typically you will want to work with a perspective camera most of the time. This post is about the camera class that is shared across all cameras, and can be thought of as a kind of home base for all content on cameras in three.js content on my site here at github pages.
