I have been toying around with [three.js](https://threejs.org/) these days, and may continue doing so until I have a solid collection of posts on it. You can count on at least a few posts on Materials which I have been working with today. If you are just getting started with three.js you might be familiar with at least the Basic Material, and that you use a Material with a Geometry to make a Mesh. However you might now be interested in working with lights, and having a material that will respond to a light source, if so the Lambert Material may be of interest.

In this post I will be writing about the [Lambert basic material](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/materials/MeshLambertMaterial) in three.js, and a basic example of it's use.
