If you work with javaScript a lot like I do chances are you are going to be aware of many of the methods that are part of the Array prototype, one of which is Array.map. In [lodash](https://lodash.com/) there is also the [\_.map](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#map) method what works just like that only it is a little more advanced. In this post I will be covering Array.map, and how it compares with what is in lodash.
