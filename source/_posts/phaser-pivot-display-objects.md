I have been making a new project as of late that makes use of [phaser](http://phaser.io) as a dependency, and came across something that I think might be worth a quick post. It has to do with setting a point that is to be a point at which a display object is to rotate. That is when I set the angle property of a display object I want to set the point at which the rotation is to occur. To do this I will want to make use of the pivot object.
