# hexo_sitesource_workshops

This is a more advanced version of what I have going on at [hexo_sitesource](https://github.com/dustinpfister/hexo_sitesource). This project contains the working folder of my hexo generated github pages site at [dustinpfister.github.io](https://dustinpfister.github.io/). I might still be using the old project, and it's theme, or at least I was at the time of this writing. This project contains an updated theme, and the source for some new plugins that I am making such as [hexo-forframe](https://github.com/dustinpfister/hexo-forframe).

## [hexo-forframe](https://github.com/dustinpfister/hexo-forframe)

This project makes use of my hexo-forframe plugin that can be used to make animations.
